# xmms-webserver
Provides a restful interface for an xmms server running on Linux.  

I am creating this application because I would like to control my music on one computer without having to switch keyboard/mouse/monitor.  I can just have xmms running on my desktop and any computer running on my network can hit the restful url and control the music.
